// Header-value sanitizer for the diagnostics headers built out of provider and
// model names (#619).
//
// Node validates every outgoing header value against RFC 7230's field-value
// grammar and throws ERR_INVALID_CHAR ("Invalid character in header content")
// on anything outside it. Relay catalogs happily hand out ids like
// `我的模型[test] v2`, and splicing one into `X-Routed-Via` killed the response
// AFTER the upstream call had already succeeded. Worse, the throw surfaced
// inside the failover loop, so the router booked it as a provider failure and
// cooled the model down — every request to that relay failed, forever.
//
// Encoding rules, deliberately narrow so the output is safe on every surface:
//   - SP and VCHAR (0x21-0x7E) pass through, so ordinary ids like
//     `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile` are byte-identical to before;
//   - everything else — control characters (header injection), DEL, and every
//     non-ASCII code point — becomes its percent-encoded UTF-8 bytes, so the
//     value stays decodable with decodeURIComponent instead of being lost;
//   - a literal '%' becomes '%25', which is what makes that decode unambiguous.
// The result is capped so a pathological id cannot push a response past a
// proxy's header budget.
